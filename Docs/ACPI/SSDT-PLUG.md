# Docs: ACPI - SSDT-PLUG

As Dortania's guide says:

```
The purpose of SSDT-PLUG is to allow the kernel's XCPM(XNU's CPU Power Management) to manage our CPU's power management. It's pretty self explanatory why you'd want this.
```

I generated `SSDT-PLUG` using [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime)
