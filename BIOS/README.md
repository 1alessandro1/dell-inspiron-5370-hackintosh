# BIOS dump

After extracting my bios using [this guide](https://github.com/dreamwhite/bios-extraction-guide/tree/master/Dell) I've applied a few changes about CFG Lock status and DVMT.
If you're interested in BIOS settings, look at [Section\_PE32\_image\_Setup.txt](Inspiron5370_Vostro5370_5471_BIOS_v1_18_1_x64.exe_extracted/Section_PE32_image_Setup.txt)
